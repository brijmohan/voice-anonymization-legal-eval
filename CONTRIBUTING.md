# Contributing to Voice Anonymization Legal Evaluation Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the legally validated voice anonymization evaluation framework! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Overview

This framework implements legally validated evaluation metrics for voice anonymization systems, based on the Article 29 Working Party's Opinion 05/2014 on Anonymization Techniques. We welcome contributions that improve the framework's accuracy, usability, and comprehensiveness.

- Use the appropriate issue template
- Provide detailed information including:
  - Description of the problem
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)
  - Error messages or logs

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features and improvements. When suggesting enhancements:

- Clearly describe the proposed feature
- Explain the motivation and use case
- Consider the legal and privacy implications
- Provide examples if possible

### 3. Code Contributions

#### Setting Up Development Environment
